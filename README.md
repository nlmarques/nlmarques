<h1>Hi, I'm Nathaniel! </h1>

I'm an early-career cybersecurity professional with nearly 2 years of hands-on IT and security training, focused on system hardening, vulnerability management, and security monitoring. I’ve recently worked with tools like Tenable Nessus, Microsoft Sentinel, and Splunk to identify threats and improve visibility across Windows and Linux environments.

From securing Active Directory infrastructures to analyzing phishing attempts and network vulnerabilities, my projects reflect a strong foundation in blue team operations, incident response, and practical cybersecurity defense.

🔐 This space highlights my technical growth, real-world lab work, and dedication to mastering the evolving cybersecurity landscape.  
🚀 Check out my projects, follow my journey, and feel free to connect!

## 🛠️ My Cybersecurity Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔒 Active Directory Setup & Hardening | Built a secure Windows Server 2019 environment with custom OUs, GPOs, and auditing. Implemented least privilege access and monitored events using Event Viewer. |
| 🔍 Vulnerability Management Lab (Coming Soon) | Performed authenticated/unauthenticated scans with Nessus on Azure-hosted VMs. Detected RCE vulnerabilities, deprecated TLS, and hardening gaps. |
| 🌐 Network Security Lab with Cisco Packet Tracer (Coming Soon) | Designed a segmented VLAN environment, configured ACLs, Syslog, and secure routing for a simulated financial network. |

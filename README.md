I'm passionate about cybersecurity and thrive on solving complex challenges through hands-on projects. Whether it’s vulnerability management, threat detection, or building secure environments, these labs reflect my commitment to staying sharp in an ever-evolving field. Feel free to explore — each project showcases the practical skills I’m building to strengthen security operations and protect digital assets.

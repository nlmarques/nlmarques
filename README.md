<h1>Hi, I'm Nathaniel! </h1>
I'm an early-career cybersecurity professional with nearly 2 years of hands-on IT and security training, focused on system hardening, vulnerability management, and security monitoring. I’ve worked with tools like Nessus, Microsoft Sentinel, and Splunk to identify threats and improve security visibility across Windows and Linux environments. From securing Active Directory infrastructures to analyzing phishing attempts and network vulnerabilities, my projects reflect a strong foundation in blue team operations and practical cybersecurity defense.

🔐 This space highlights my technical growth, real-world lab work, and dedication to mastering the evolving cybersecurity landscape.
